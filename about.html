    <section class="story-essay">
      <p>
        ‚ÄúTell something about yourself?‚Äù It could be one of the toughest
        questions when asked impulsively. However, people who like sharing their
        achievements and personal life with others may find it another
        opportunity to reveal their unique traits. But with me, the case is
        quite the opposite. Talking about myself has never been my thing. Yet, I
        would still try to describe myself in the best way I can. I would like
        to start with my background and then move to how I am as a student and
        then how I am inside and how the world sees me.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first thing that I would like to write to introduce myself is that I
        am nothing but just a unique kind of ‚Äòsubstance‚Äô made up of hydrogen,
        carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, trying to leave a positive mark in the
        world. In the effort to do so, I have been continuously changing
        qualitatively. Being an only child raised by a single mother, I have had
        quite a rough childhood. Giving up on my aspirations and wishes was a
        normal part of my life. Living with limited luxuries and growing up
        without a father and siblings has a massive role in my personality
        today. I know how it is like not to have someone to hear you out when
        you come back home after a terrible day at school. Hence, I always try
        to be an ear to my friends and make them feel better.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, I never let my financial constraints and not-so-easy family
        life get in the way of my academic goals. On the contrary, I have always
        been keen to learn new things and achieve good grades. As a result, I
        successfully managed to land in my dream college, that too on
        scholarship. Getting into college on scholarship was one of my biggest
        dreams as well as a major goal. Besides, it gave me a chance to make my
        mother proud of me. Making her a proud mother has always been my dream,
        and I can‚Äôt be happier to achieve some aspect of that dream.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, I would like to tell you that I may seem like a bright student
        who is confident and arrogant. But, in actuality, it is the opposite. I
        am a person that has to deal with social anxiety every day, which means
        I have to struggle a lot to make new friends, attend social events, and
        give presentations. I never tend to initiate a conversation or say
        enough to keep the conversation going with many people I don‚Äôt know.
        This may give them the impression that I am an arrogant teen. But, from
        the inside, I am as humble as a dove. I can never say no to anyone, and
        I can never ignore someone who needs help. I am as fragile as glass. My
        confidence level can go to zero on one uncomfortable remark.
      </p>

      <p>
        All in all, this is precisely who I am as a person. And, I believe my
        experiences and relationships with others have a great role in making me
        what I am today. After all, humans are social animals. So, no matter how
        introverted or timid I am, I still need real connections that help me
        experience life at its best.
